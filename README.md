# Weakly Supervised Object Detection
My implementations of a variety of algorithms and models for the weakly supervised object detection problem, based on facebookresearch/detectron2

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Latest Pytorch (1.3.1 as of last readme update)
- Latest Torchvision (0.4.2 as of last readme update)
- Detectron2
